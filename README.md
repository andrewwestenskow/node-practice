# Node extra practice

Use the included dummy data to build a back end application to interact with the data set

## Instructions

1. Run `npm init -y` to initialize npm in this repository
2. Install express and cors as dependencies for the project.
3. Build out your file structure including a `server` folder containing both an `index.js` and a `usersController.js` file.
4. Build out a basic express server, listening on any port above 3001
5. Create a GET endpoint to retrieve all users
6. Create a second GET endpoint to retrieve a user based on their id (use a param)
7. Modify your first GET endpoint to retrieve users based on their state, name, or favorite movie (use a query)
8. Write a POST endpoint to add a new user
9. Write a PUT endpoint to edit an existing user
10. Write a DELETE endpoint to delete a user based on their id

### If you finish that

1. Run `create-react-app .` in the current directory to generate a front end.
2. Create a front end interface to interact with this data set. Display all of your users and make them searchable.
   1. Have some fun with the styling here. Experiment with different layouts and color schemes.
3. Create forms to edit existing users or add new ones
4. Create a button to delete users.
